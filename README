== About

Arcadia is a Light Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Ruby language 
written in Ruby using the classic tcl/tk GUI toolkit.

Some of Arcadia ide project features include:
* Editor with source browsing, syntax highlighting, code completion
* Working on any platform where ruby and tcl-tk work.
* Debugging support
* Highly extensibility architecture.

== In this release 0.11.0
    
[Improvements]
  added some new features: 
  - now you can open more than one instance of "Editor" and "Dir Project"
    by clicking on button with "plus" icon on the left side of title bar.
    This can be usefull if you want see 2 buffers at the same time. 
  - now you can hide the tabs in Editor (for optimizing space) by menu item :
    "View->Show/Hide Editor Tabs" and recall a buffer by menubutton on right side 
    of title bar
  - porting to new version of coderay   
  
  A lot of bugs fixed !!!

== Short User guide
Application layout is splitted in vertical and horizontal resizable frames. 
On vertical and horizontal  splitter appear two button for left or right 
one shot frame close. 
Every frame has a title, a button to expand or resizing it and a menu-button 
for dynamic layout functions (like add row, add column, close or for move a frame).

==== Main Toolbar
The toolbar button are in order:
- new, open, save, find
  (relatively to edit/find operation)
  after "new" there is a menubutton to choose a type of file
- run current, run last 
  (for execute the raised file in the editor or the last runned file)  
  after "run current" there is a menubutton to choose a configurated runner to apply at current file
- debug current, debug last, quit debug panel
  (for debug need)
- quit (to exit from arcadia)

==== Editor
Editor can use the notebook metaphor. Same command are on the popup menu 
that is raised on "Button-3" click event fundamentally for closing the tab 
under the mouse pointer.
These are same editor short-cut:
- Ctrl-c  => copy selected text
- Ctrl-v  => paste copied text
- Ctrl-x  => cut selected text
- Ctrl-g  => show go to line dialog
- Ctrl-o  => show open file dialog
- Ctrl-z  => undo
- Ctrl-r  => redo
- Ctrl-f  => copy the selected text on input combobox of find dialog and moves focus
- Ctrl-s  => save
- Ctrl-space or esc => completion code
- Ctrl-shift-i or Tab => indent the selected block
- Ctrl-shift-u or Shift-Tab => unindent the selected block
- Ctrl-shift-c => comment/uncomment the selected code block
- Alt-shift-a => select all
- Alt-shift-i => invert selection
- Alt-shift-u => selected to uppercase
- Alt-shift-l => selected to lowercase
- F5 => execute the current file 
- F3 => find/ find next
- Ctrl-F3 => Search in files

- Double-Click on line number set or unset a debug breakpoint

==== Project drawer
It is a navigational tree: 
- open or create dir as project
- make commons file system activity (by contextual menu)

==== File history
The last used files are organizing in tree so you can reopen them or there  
directory by clicking on the tree node.

==== Debug
Require ruby-debug gem.
It is created when a debug session init. 
The debug button are: Step Next, Step Into, Step Over, Resume and quit.
The debug frame show the local, instance and global variables for each
step. 

==== Configuration
Same Arcadia properties are locally configurabled by editing the file arcadia.conf
under ~/.arcadia  directory. The format of property definition are:
<OPERATING SYSTEM IDENTIFY::>PROPERTY_NAME=PROPERTY_VALUE


I have tested arcadia with ruby 1.8.4, 1.8.5, 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 on 

* Archlinux
* Ubuntu
* Fedora
* FreeBsd6.x, FreeBsd7.x, 
* Vector linux 5.*,
* Windows 2000/XP/7, 
* Cygwin (note: same page fault error on dll under cygwin may be solved in this way:
  by ash.exe exec "/bin/rebaseall"). 
If you will test arcadia on other operating system sends me an e-mail.
